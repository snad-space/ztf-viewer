# SNAD ZTF DR web viewer
#### https://ztf.snad.space

This projects contains a source of [ZTF](http://ztf.caltech.edu) Data Releases light curve viewer developed by [the SNAD team](http://snad.space).

Please use [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/snad-space/ztf-viewer/issues) for suggestions and bug reports. If the Portal is unavailable or some functionality doesn’t work, please check the [status page](https://status.snad.space/status/viewer). If it’s red, we are already aware of the problem; if not, please report it to us!

## Evaluation

 Both production and development versions can be started via [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) using `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.dev.yml` correspondingly.
 Current production configuration assumes that there is a Docker `proxy` network shared with [`jwilder/nginx-proxy`](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy) which proxies the webserver to the outer world.
 Also, this configuration requires `secret.env` file containing secret environment variables, such as API keys.

### Environment variables

Environment variables to configure the server, see default values in `config.py`:
- `CACHE_TYPE`: cache type, specify `redis` to use [redis](https://redis.io) server, or `memory` to use in-process cache
- `UNAVAILABLE_CATALOGS_CACHE_TYPE`: unavailable catalog cache type, specify `redis` to use [redis](https://redis.io) server, or `memory` to use in-process cache
- `REDIS_URL`: redis server address
- `LC_API_URL`: SNAD ZTF database API address
- `AKB_API_URL`: knowledge database address
- `FEATURES_API_URL`: feature extraction service address
- `OGLE_III_API_URL`: SNAD OGLE III mirror address
- `ZTF_PERIODIC_API_URL`: SNAD mirror of the ZTF periodic variables catalog
- `TNS_API_URL`: SNAD mirror of the TNS
- `ZTF_FITS_PROXY_URL`: address of SNAD proxy for ZTF FITS
- `JS9_URL`: address of full-functional JS9 viewer supporting `JS9.LoadProxy`

### Running development docker-compose

You could run a development version of the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8050` using `docker-compose.dev.yml` file:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

This will run Dash/Flask server in debug mode and will reload the server on code changes if you mount the source code directory `ztf_viewer` as a volume:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml -f docker-compose.dev.local.yml up --build
```

### Running without docker

The server can be run locally without Docker in debug mode.

```sh
# Configure Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv ~/.virtualenv/ztf-viewer
source ~/.virtualenv/ztf-viewer/bin/activate

# Install the package
python -m pip install -e .

# Run webserver
CACHE_TYPE="memory" UNAVAILABLE_CATALOGS_CACHE_TYPE="memory" python -m ztf_viewer
```

Go to the url specified in the command line output, it should be something like http://localhost:8050/
Some features like FITS viewer wouldn't work.
